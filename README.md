# MMORPG_Enviro_Lite

Add EnviroLiteNetPlayer.cs to Player(s) prefab(s) and from Enviro Skymanager, assign Player Tag to PlayerTag and Camera Tag to MainCamera.

On your Map Scene(s), create a new GameObject and rename it for example EnviroNet. Add Enviro Lite Net Server script and Lite Net Lib Identity script to just create GameObject.

Thanks Skiller for original code.
